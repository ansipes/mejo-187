## Introduction

The goal of this assignment is to create a beautiful, effective, user-friendly portfolio website using WordPress. Your audience consists of potential employers.

- Build a personal portfolio website using a WordPress theme
- Value: 15% of grade
- Project due: By 11:59 PM, Monday, April 6, 2020
- Submit your online URL to Sakai

## Strategy

A great portfolio website answers the following three questions in 10 seconds or less:

1. Who are you?
2. What do you do?
3. Are you good at it?

Do not start to build your portfolio website until you have answered these three questions. The brainstorming phase is the most important part of this project. Who are you? What is your brand? Maybe you've known exactly what you've wanted to do since you were in kindergarten and you already have a body of work to show it; you won't have to think too hard to answer the questions above. Congratulations. We all hate you. But if you're like many, if not most, undergraduate students, you'll have to sit down and give this some serious thought. Maybe you don't have a clear answer, and that's okay. Make that your brand. Showcase your skills and interests, and tell the world you're young and smart, so it's okay that you're still figuring it out.

This project does not require a lot of coding (although you will inevitably have to code parts of your site). Nor does it require much sui generis design (you're mostly tweaking a theme that someone else designed). What it does require is creativity and forethought.

## Workflow

1. Answer the three questions above.
2. Asset Inventory - While answering the questions, comb through your work. All of it, everything you've ever done that exists in a digital format or can be easily digitized. Put it into three categories: I definitely want to include this; maybe I want to include it, but it's not my best stuff; definitely leave this one out. If you don't have a lot of work to showcase, think about your skills and come up with a list of instances in which you put your skills to use. For this project, your assets must include:
   - A logo. This can be a custom logo that you build in Photoshop or Illustrator and/or or a custom font (e.g., Google Font) for your name and tagline.
   - A tagline. See above.
   - A link to your Project II.
   - At least four (4) examples of your other work. These can be articles, stories, photos, photo essays, graphics, designs, multimedia pieces, press releases, advertisements, etc. If you don't have a large body of visual and/or written work, and instead want to highlight your accomplishments (e.g., instances of problems you solved, challenges you met...see above), you still need visuals. Have a photographer friend take some great photos of you doing your thing and use them as thumbnails or background photos for each accomplishment. Or maybe use icons. Get creative. 
   - Feel free to include a link your Project 1 XD prototype, but keep in mind that in its current form, anyone with an Adobe ID can add comments to a public XD prototype once they have the URL.
   - A link to a printable PDF version of your resume. 
3. Conceptual Phase - Once you know your brand and what assets you will use to showcase that brand, check out the competition. Find your heroes -- the people with your dream job -- and see what their portfolios look like. Look at awwwards for inspiration.
4. Content Strategy - Decide how you want to organize your content. Do you want a single-page scrolling site or a multi-page site? What categories will be in your main nav? How will the site flow from one section to the next?
5. Load your assets into your Media Library using the default 2019 theme.
6. Explore other WordPress themes - Go to Appearance > Themes > Add New. Using the Feature Filter and/or Search bar, explore the themes that best fit your brand and design plans. Let the themes work for you, not the other way around. If you absolutely know you want a certain feature in your design (e.g., parallax), choose a theme that already has that feature built in. Don't try to redesign an existing theme to fit your needs. Remember: you're not stuck with your first choice. You can install multiple themes, live preview them with the assets you've uploaded to your Media Library, and activate them/deactivate them as you please. Refer to the lecture slides in Sakai. You may also purchase a theme, if you find one that you think is worth the money, but do your homework (e.g., check the reviews, number of times it's been installed). There are plenty of good themes available for free. If you are unsure, use one of the themes that come installed by default, e.g., twenty nineteen, twenty seventeen. They're the default for a reason.
7. Create your Pages and Posts. Build the core structure of your site and organize the menu.
8. Choose a Contact Form plugin and decide where and how you want to incorporate it into your site.
9. Find another plugin that will enhance your site (e.g., masonry layout, animation, etc.). There are plugins for almost anything you can think of...but as always, be tasteful. Note: You may NOT a page-builder plugin (and you probably wouldn't want to, anyway).
10. Customize the theme as needed, using the Additional CSS panel, dev tools, and your own ID's and classes that you create in the code for each page.

## Checklist and Submission

You will simply submit your main website URL in Sakai (e.g., www.myname.com). Before you do, make sure you've included all of the following:

- A logo and tagline
- A link to Project 2 and at least four (4) other examples of your work.
- A contact form plugin
- Another plugin to enhance the front-end design of your site
- A link to a printable PDF of your resume.
- Well-written, typo-free, grammatically correct text. I will take off points for bad spelling and grammar. You will be showing this to potential employers, not just me, so it must be spotless.
