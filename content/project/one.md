## Introduction

This project is worth 15% of your final grade in this class. The goal of this project is to create a responsive website design based on a single topic from your semester theme.

You will create wireframes and color comps with a color scheme and text treatment that is consistent with the content of the site that you are creating. It should be professional and look like it could appear in an online newspaper or magazine.

## Due Date

The project is due Thursday at 8:45 PM, September 24th. Late work will receive 5 points off during the first 24 hours after the deadline, and 10 points off for each 24 hours period after that. Even if there is no credit left to earn on an assignment, you are always encouraged to turn it in for feedback.

## Requirements

Design a set of wireframes and design comps using Adobe XD and the grid layout we discuss in class. Here are the art boards you will need to make. For all work going forward in this class, we will use iPhone X to represent mobile and Web 1280x720 to represent desktop. Make sure you pick those two types of art boards when designing.

- 1 Mobile Home Page Wireframe Art Board
- 2 Mobile Inside Page Wireframe Art Boards
- 1 Desktop Home Page Wireframe Art Board
- 2 Desktop Inside Page Wireframe Art Boards
- 1 Style Tile
- 1 Mobile Home Page Prototype Art Board
- 2 Mobile Inside Page Prototype Art Boards
- 1 Desktop Home Page Prototype Art Board
- 2 Desktop Inside Page Prototype Art Boards

There should be one (1) XD project with at least thirteen (13) art boards. I recommend you create the wireframes first, then duplicate each one and work off them to build your color comps. Design the entire page; that includes scrolling content below the bottom border each art board. Include enough content to show the design for your chosen section of the story; you can indicate the existence of the extra text by fading it out at the bottom, adding a 'read more' button, etc. It's up to you.

Please annotate your wireframes to help explain any UI/UX features that cannot be demonstrated with XD prototyping methods. Before you conclude that something cannot be done in XD, do a quick Google and also ask me before writing an annotation. I will deduct points if you make an annotation for some interactive element that could have been modeled in XD.

Be creative but tasteful. Usability is paramount.

You will also do a one-page writeup about why you chose to design the site the way you did. Explain your creative decisions regarding the interactive features, color scheme, typography choices, layout, and style.

## Process

I highly recommend following this process when working on this project.

### Wireframes

Start by making the wireframes for the mobile versions of your homepage and interior pages. Then make the desktop versions of the home and interior pages' wireframes. You should have two sets of wireframes, one for mobile and one for desktop, each with at least three art boards.

### Style Tile

Consider the brand of this client. Decide the fonts for your heading, subheading, and paragraph text. Design repeating components like navbars, buttons, sliders, cards, etc. Express these succinctly using a style tile.

### Prototype

Go to prototype view and start with your mobile wireframes. Connect the homepage frame to the interior pages and back. Link to other art boards as needed to demonstrate the functionality of hamburger menus, carousels, animation, etc. Then do the same for the desktop wireframes, mobile prototypes, and desktop prototypes.

I highly recommend wiring all of your home pages up to the Style Tile. Basically, I just add four terms to my Style Tile:

- Mobile Wireframe
- Mobile Prototype
- Desktop Wireframe
- Desktop Prototype

Then I link each of those individual terms to the home page of each respective set of art boards. By doing this, you can share your entire project as just one link, instead of four separate links.

### Writeup

Write a one-page document that explains your web design choices. I want to see that you've read the story, considered its themes, and thought about how to best tell the story. Ask yourself the following questions and answer them, in brief prose, in your writeup:

- Who is my audience?
- What elements would appeal to that audience?
- How would they likely access the site (mobile or desktop)?
- What is my competition (i.e. similar projects)?
- How does my visual design fit the themes of the story while staying consistent with my chosen branding?
- What purpose do my interactive features serve? How do they help tell the story?

## Assets

The actual content that will populate the site / design.

### Title

The title of the topic article.

### Subtitle

Text that is no longer that a sentence that gives more detail.

### Introduction

A paragraph discussing the purpose of the site.

### Images

Source these from Unsplash and other royalty free websites.

### Navigation

These pages need to be included in your navigation menu, but don't necessarily need to be created as art boards. You should probably pick two of them though, for your inside pages.

- Story
- About
- Photo Gallery
- Timeline
- Video Interview

## Grading

You must earn every point. You earn points by showing you understand the concepts to create a beautiful and usable web design. The purpose of this assignment is not to follow rules or a checklist but to create a professional, well-designed website. Your task is to show me you understand everything you have learned about quality web design up to this point. This project should be at a level you would be proud to show a potential employer.

### Web Design Principles

25 Points

All Web pages have exceptionally attractive and seemingly usable layouts. They were designed effectively to the grid. Contrast, repetition, alignment, and proximity were used successfully to organize and present material.

### Colors and Typography

15 Points

Colors of background, fonts, links, etc. form a pleasing palette, do not detract from the content, and are consistent across all pages.

Type is legible and consistent. Use of font weight, form, and direction are used consistently and improve readability and attractiveness.

### Organization and Specification

15 Points

Clear and consistent annotations that describe the interactivity of the site. Clear use of Adobe XD features like grouping, components, and asset management (colors, for example). Clear justification and explaination of design process in writeup.

### Content

15 Points

The site has a wellstated clear purpose and theme that is carried out throughout all pages. The content chosen for the homepage makes sense.

### Requirements

15 Points

The project was turned in on time, and all 13 art boards were completed and presented professionally. All required assets were included in the design. All interactions and navigations were properly wired in Adobe XD's prototype view.

### Above and Beyond

15 points

Designer went above and beyond project requirements. Here are some examples:

- Create additional, relevant, high quality art boards that clearly complement the project and topic (i.e. not a contact page or social media page, more is not always more)
- Implement advanced or novel interactive elements that enhance the user experience or the way information is presented
- Stunning layout and design
- ...

Earning these points usually requires some level of self learning / exploration – just like in the working world. Please make sure to reference our resource page for inspiration. If you have questions about how to go above and beyond, always feel free to email me.

## Feedback and Assistance

I am happy to deliver early feedback to you as long as you submit your project to me by Friday, February 7th. If you submit it to me later than that, I may or may not have enough time before the due date. If you need any help, make sure to ask for help in class, or schedule office hours with me.

## Submission

If you organize your project in the way described above, you should be able to share everything with a single link. Please paste that link in the Sakai submission box, and attach your writeup as a PDF.

Do not copy these examples. If you copy them and expect a certain grade, you will be disappointed.
