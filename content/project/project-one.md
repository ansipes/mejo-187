## Introduction

This project is worth 15% of your final grade in this class. The goal of this project is to create a responsive website design based on the 1985 Pulitzer-prize winning story “Life on the Land.” Before you start designing, you will want to read the five-part series by John Sanford.

## Alternatives

You are welcome to use an alternative topic, but it must have sufficient text content so won't need to use lorem ipsum everywhere. You may not pick a topic already covered in a previous assignment. You must submit your alternative topic to me via email by 7:45 PM Wednesday, January 29th. I will review it, and let you know whether it is approved or not that night. Make sure to include details simliar to the ones included in this brief. For example, discuss the brand and feel you'll aim to replicate in your submission.

## Brief

For the purpose of this project, we are going to imagine the New York Times is hiring you to design a multimedia website for this written story. You will create wireframes and color comps with a color scheme and text treatment that is consistent with the content of the site that you are creating. You should use the assets provided, and you need to design a layout with typography and color scheme that you believe fits with the project. It should be professional and look like it could appear on the New York Times.

## Requirements

Design a set of wireframes and design comps using Adobe XD and the grid layout we discuss in class. Here are the art boards you will need to make.

- 1 Mobile Home Page Wireframe Art Board
- 2 Mobile Inside Page Wireframe Art Boards
- 1 Desktop Home Page Wireframe Art Board
- 2 Desktop Inside Page Wireframe Art Boards
- 1 Style Tile
- 1 Mobile Home Page Prototype Art Board
- 2 Mobile Inside Page Prototype Art Boards
- 1 Desktop Home Page Prototype Art Board
- 2 Desktop Inside Page Prototype Art Boards

There should be one (1) XD project with at least thirteen (13) art boards. I recommend you create the wireframes first, then duplicate each one and work off them to build your color comps. Design the entire page; that includes scrolling content below the bottom border each art board. You do not, however, need to include all of the text from the Sanford story. Just include enough to show the design for your chosen section of the story; you can indicate the existence of the extra text by fading it out at the bottom, adding a 'read more' button, etc. It's up to you.

Please annotate your wireframes to help explain any UI/UX features that cannot be demonstrated with XD prototyping methods. Before you conclude that something cannot be done in XD, do a quick Google and also ask me before writing an annotation. I will deduct points if you make an annotation for some interactive element that could have been modeled in XD.

Be creative but tasteful. Usability is paramount.

You will also do a one-page writeup about why you chose to design the site the way you did. Explain your creative decisions regarding the interactive features, color scheme, typography choices, layout, and style.  

## Process

I highly recommend following this process when working on this project.

### Wireframes

Start by making the wireframes for the mobile versions of your homepage and interior pages. Then make the desktop versions of the home and interior pages' wireframes. You should have two sets of wireframes, one for mobile and one for desktop, each with at least three art boards.

### Style Tile

Consider the brand of this client. Decide the fonts for your heading, subheading, and paragraph text. Design repeating components like navbars, buttons, sliders, cards, etc. Express these succinctly using a style tile.

### Prototype

Go to prototype view and start with your mobile wireframes. Connect the homepage frame to the interior pages and back. Link to other art boards as needed to demonstrate the functionality of hamburger menus, carousels, animation, etc. Then do the same for the desktop wireframes, mobile prototypes, and desktop prototypes.

I highly recommend wiring all of your home pages up to the Style Tile. Basically, I just add three terms to my Style Tile:

- Mobile Wireframe
- Mobile Prototype
- Desktop Wireframe
- Desktop Prototype

By doing this, you can share your entire project as just one link, instead of four separate links.

### Writeup

Write a one-page document that explains your web design choices. I want to see that you've read the story, considered its themes, and thought about how to best tell the story. Ask yourself the following questions and answer them, in brief prose, in your writeup:

- Who is my audience?
- What elements would appeal to that audience?
- How would they likely access the site (mobile or desktop)?
- What is my competition (i.e. similar projects)?
- How does my visual design fit the themes of the story while staying consistent with New York Times branding?
- What purpose do my interactive features serve? How do they help tell the story?

## Assets

You will need to include these assets unless otherwise noted. If you are doing an alternative topic, you should have a subsitute for all of the assets listed below.

### Title

"I Am A Farmer." – You can edit/change this if you wish (I recommend that you do). You will want to design the title typography, thinking about which words should be emphasized, and how the words should be read.

### Subtitle

Portrait of an American Farm Family (You can edit/change this if you wish.)

### Introduction

As America shifts towards a more urbanization, rural farmers face economic crisis in a rapidly changing culture. David Benson, a Minnesota farmer, shares his story about surviving with his family in a rural setting and his family’s history of working the land. 

### Images

A folder of 20 images (including NYT logos) is provided in the Project 1 folder in the Resources section of Sakai. IMPORTANT NOTE: For the purposes of this assignment, we will assume all these images are of the Benson family members and their farm, although they are not. You should make your photo editing choices based on this assumption. You can always grab more images from photo websites detailed on our resources page. You do not need to use all of these images.

### Navigation

These pages need to be included in your navigation menu, but don't necessarily need to be created.

- Story
- About
- Photo Gallery
- Timeline
- Video Interview

## Grading

You must earn every point. You earn points by showing you understand the concepts to create a beautiful and usable web design. The purpose of this assignment is not to follow rules or a checklist but to create a professional, well-designed website. Your task is to show me you understand everything you have learned about quality web design up to this point. This project should be at a level you would be proud to show a potential employer.

### Web Design Principles

25 Points

All Web pages have exceptionally attractive and seemingly usable layouts. They were designed effectively to the grid. Contrast, repetition, alignment, and proximity were used successfully to organize and present material.

### Colors and Typography

15 Points

Colors of background, fonts, links, etc. form a pleasing palette, do not detract from the content, and are consistent across all pages.

Type is legible and consistent. Use of font weight, form, and direction are used consistently and improve readability and attractiveness.

### Organization and Specification

15 Points

Clear and consistent annotations that describe the interactivity of the site. Clear use of Adobe XD features like grouping, components, and asset management (colors, for example). Clear justification and explaination of design process in writeup.

### Content

15 Points

The site has a wellstated clear purpose and theme that is carried out throughout all pages. The content chosen for the homepage makes sense.

### Requirements

15 Points

The project was turned in on time, and all 13 art boards were completed and presented professionally. All required assets were included in the design. All interactions and navigations were properly wired in Adobe XD's prototype view.

### Above and Beyond

15 points

Designer went above and beyond project requirements. Here are some examples:

- Create additional, relevant, high quality art boards that clearly complement the project and topic (i.e. not a contact page or social media page, more is not always more)
- Implement advanced or novel interactive elements that enhance the user experience or the way information is presented
- Stunning layout and design
- ...

Earning these points usually requires some level of self learning / exploration – just like in the working world. Please make sure to reference our resource page for inspiration. If you have questions about how to go above and beyond, always feel free to email me.
