## Introduction

For your final project, you will be telling a story in the form of an interactive dashboard. The project will be a single-page web app that features a main interactive graphic (e.g., a timeline) and data visualization in the form of a Google Chart. It will tie together all of the skills you have learned in this class, including visual design, information architecture, branding, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It should be beautiful, compelling, and user-friendly. The app should be a true “dashboard;” that is, it should have minimal text on the screen, other than the title and a brief introduction, and it must entice the user to explore and read the story by interacting with the various visual elements on the page. 

## The Story

You may choose any non-fiction topic you wish, within reason, or you may choose to cover one of the two suggested topics below. If you choose to pursue your own story, it must be credible and compelling. The story must be well-researched and cited, the information must be accurate, and the data must be reliable. Most importantly, the story must lend itself to an interactive treatment and data visualization. The best topics for this project will be ones that can be naturally segmented into a sequence of individual items, such as years, people, places, etc., and have reliable data from which you can build a Google Chart.

Remember, this story will be published -- in your website, at the very least. It will likely be viewed by potential employers, so choose something in line with your interests and ambitions. With hard work and foresight, you may even produce something that you can pitch to online publications.

All this being said, if you wish to pursue your own story for this project, you must pitch the idea to me with a brief message in Sakai before the start of class. In your pitch, please explain your idea and show that you have reliable data and readily available assets (e.g., images). I don’t want you scrambling to find data on your topic with one week to go, when you should be coding.

The three suggested topics are:

- The novel coronavirus
- The history of smart phones

These two topics have been chosen because they lend themselves well to interactive features and data visualization. There are plenty more -- many of which feature more somber, timely material -- but I'll let you explore current events and consider those ideas for yourselves, rather than suggesting them for you.

Following is a short list of sources for reliable data sets. These are good starting points, but there are many others, so start exploring.

- [The Milne Library of Open Data Sets](http://libguides.geneseo.edu/data)
- [Data.gov](https://www.data.gov/)
- [U.S. Census Bureau](https://www.census.gov/data.html)
- [MEAD (Magazine of Early American Datasets)](https://repository.upenn.edu/mead/)
- [Pew Research Center](http://www.pewinternet.org/datasets/)

## The Main Interactive

This will be the heart of your project; it’s where you will tell the story. As mentioned earlier, the content should be revealed primarily through interactive elements. It should not be a static article complimented by an interactive graphic; rather, it should be the reverse: the text content and/or other assets should be revealed in sections as the user explores the interactive.

Timelines are good bets; you can make an attractive, interactive timeline with the JavaScript skills you will be learning in this class. Of course, how you build that timeline – and what interactive features it employs – are up to you. You could create a static timeline of divs with toggle events. You could create a slider in which each new section of the story appears in a single static div when the user clicks the next and previous buttons. You could control the progress of a timeline with an HTML range slider ... etc., etc.

If your topic is not one that lends itself to a chronological sequence, you may use a different form of interactive graphic, such as an interactive illustration (for the graphic designers in the class), photo gallery, etc.

## The Google Chart

This is the data visualization section of the dashboard. It should supplement the main interactive in your dashboard, but that doesn’t mean it should be given short shrift. The challenge is to find a “story” in your data and tell that story in the Google Chart. It should reveal something interesting, noteworthy, and true.

You should choose a Google Chart that fits your data, not the other way around. For example, to visualize the current market share of each major brand of smartphone, you might choose a pie chart. But if you wanted to show how that market share has changed over time, you might want to create a stacked bar chart.

Please keep this in mind: the content of your Google Chart will be more of a challenge than coding it. You will be more or less implementing the script for your chosen chart -- yes, that means copying and pasting the JS code that Google gives you – by inserting your own data and customizing it as you see fit. But if the 'story' told by your data is unclear, inaccurate, or irrelevant, it will ruin your entire project. 

## The Layout

This will be a single-page web app, hosted on your server as a branch off of your main portfolio (e.g., www.yourname.com/project4).  As such, the style should be consistent with brand you established in your WordPress portfolio (project 3), and it should feature the same logo that you used in that site. The app must be responsive, using the CSS methods we've discussed. Please consider this when planning your interactive graphic; it must look good on both desktop and mobile. This may require using a different layout for your interactive in different viewports. I will pay attention to your responsive code (or lack thereof) when assessing the design.

All of the content in the interactive dashboard should be available to the user without going to a new page. You will have links to your outside sources, of course, but the list of sources should not be put in a separate HTML page; it should appear in a lightbox or other modal window when the user clicks on the “Sources” object.

Following is the list of required items in this project app:

1. Logo that links back to your WordPress portfolio site
2. Story title
3. Short introduction
4. Main interactive graphic (e.g. timeline) built with pure JavaScript
5. Google Chart
6. A modal window for your Sources, built in pure JavaScript

## Grading

Following is a general breakdown, so you can plan accordingly:

### Functionality

The app must meet all of the requirements, and all of the interactive elements must work, without glitches. Your code should be clean, efficient, commented, and complete (no missing meta tags or alt tags on images, etc.). The app’s responsiveness should be handled primarily through Grid and/or Flex, with adjustments on individual elements, if necessary. Your code should incorporate the best practices we’ve discussed in class.

### Design

Your design should look great on mobile and desktop; but remember, usability is paramount, especially with interactive features. According to Apple’s Human Interface Guidelines, the target area for touch events should be at least 44 pixels wide by 44 pixels tall. The layout should be aesthetically pleasing and intuitive. It should fit with the style established in your portfolio. You should demonstrate your understanding of design principles (CCS and CRAP).

### Content

Your story should be accurate, compelling, and well-researched. You should provide sources for all data. The content should be free of grammatical and typographical errors.

Now that the hair of this final project has been split a hundred ways…remember: have fun. This is an opportunity to shine and show your passion. Make something awesome now, and you’ll get paid to make something awesome later.

## Examples

Here are some examples of work from previous semesters. These are not flawless, and their designs should not, necessarily, be emulated. Your own story should inform your own design.
