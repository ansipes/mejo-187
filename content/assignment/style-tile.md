## Introduction

You have now read about all of the components that make up a style tile. Create one using the archetype assigned to you in class.

## Requirements

Your style tile needs to have these things.

- Heading
- Subheading
- Body
- Buttons
- Navbar
- Block Quote
- Colors

You can go the extra mile by adding in some hover states. This should all be on one art board. Write about five sentences explaining you choices, and make sure to note the archetype you were assigned.

Please submit this on Sakai.
