## Introduction

You have now read about all of the components that make up a style tile. Create one using the archetype assigned to you in class.

## Requirements

Your style tile needs to have these things.

- Heading
- Subheading
- Body
- Buttons
- Navbar
- Block Quote
- Colors

You can go the extra mile by adding in some hover states. This should all be on one art board.

Please submit this on Sakai.
