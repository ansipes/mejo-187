## Introduction

You will create wireframes and prototypes in Adobe XD. Follow this guide to download and install Adobe XD on your computer. Please confirm completion of this assignment on Sakai.

## Go to Software Aquisition

While you can technically get Adobe XD directly from Adobe for free â€“ there is a catch. You will not be able to share your wireframes and prototypes using a share link. For this reason, you will need to get Adobe Creative Cloud for free via UNC ITS Software Aquisition.
