## Introduction

The objective of this exercise is to practice the Web Design Process and apply Web Design Principles.

## Activity

You will work with a small group of peers to design two pages of a client's website. You will use the Web Design Process to create this design – make sure to reference it as you go along.

You'll want to submit a brief explanation for each of the first three steps – then you'll turn in five art boards in your Adobe XD project. The art boards should be sized like an iPhone X. Those art boards should include:

- A style tile
- A home page wireframe
- An inside page wireframe
- A home page prototype
- An inside page prototype

## Directions

1. Open a notebook
2. Discuss the Web Design Process with your peers
3. Document your thoughts on the first three steps
4. Create an art board for a home wireframe and an inside page wireframe
5. Populate those wireframes with the essential user interface elements and discuss with your peers
6. Create an art board for a style tile
7. Populate that style tile with colors, fonts, and other styles you wish to apply in the prototype and discuss with your peers
8. Create an art board for a home prototype and an inside page prototype
9. Populate those prototypes with content and wire them up for basic user interaction
10. Get a share URL for your XD file and submit it on Sakai, along with your notes from the other steps of the Web Design Process
