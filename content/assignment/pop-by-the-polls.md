## Introduction

This assignment focuses on content sourcing, journalism, and web development. We will be creating a small website that details issues being discussed during this election, a small profile on a candidate, details of a local polling place, and an HTML form of a voting ballot.

## Research Issues

The first step of this assignment is to visit a site that will display issues being discussed this election cycle. After you finish the quiz, you will be presented with a selection of candidates that match the responses on the issues.

[Visit ISideWith](https://www.isidewith.com/)

From this quiz, pick out four issues / questions that were asked. Write a sentence about each, in a balanced way. That is, explain the issue / question itself, but do not convey your thinking on it.

## Pick Candidate

This does not have to be a candidate that you prefer or identify with. You can research whichever candidate you like. Put together a short paragraph discussing the issues that matter the most to the candidate. You might include some interesting facts about the candidate as well.

To be clear, this does not have to be informed by, or be representative of, your personal beliefs in any way. You could do a profile on Vermin Supreme if you wanted, so long as you researched him like any other candidate.

## Visit Polling Place

Your next task is to visit a polling place. Luckily, there is a one right by campus! It is at Chapel of the Cross.

It is open from 8:00 AM to 7:30 PM. You can look up other early voting locations here:

[One Stop Voting Locations](https://vt.ncsbe.gov/ossite/)

When you are there, you need to do three things:

- Take a photo outside the entrance
- Grab a sample ballot (Democratic or Republican, it does not matter)
- Take notes on what it is like (busy, slow, calm, volunteers, etc)

## Vote (optional)

You are required to visit a polling place for this assignment. You are not required to vote. If you wanted to vote, you could do it while you are there.

You can register and vote on the same day in North Carolina, from now until the end of the month.

All you need is proof of residency for this county. That could be:

- Utility Bill
- Bank Statement
- Government Check
- Paycheck
- Government Document

Even if you are from out of state, or your family lives somewhere else in North Carolina, you can still vote here if you consider this your "permanent home", as in, you spend the majority of your time here and plan to stay after graduating. You cannot vote in multiple places.

**You are not required to vote for this assignment. You will not receive any reward for voting. You will not be penalized for not voting. You will not be asked if you voted.**

## One Page Website

Make a one page website that has five sections.

### Navigation

Here, you will put the 2020 logo (I'll give it to you), the text "Pop by the Polls", and links to the other four sections of the one page website.

### Issues

Here, you will talk about three issues detailed on ISideWith. Just state them in a plain, non-partisan fashion. One or two sentences for each will be fine.

### Candidate

Here, you will write your paragraph about the candidate you researched. You will also put a photo of that candidate.

### Polling Place

Here, you will write your paragraph about your experience at the early voting location. What was it like? Were there volunteers? Signs? You will also include your photo here.

### Ballot

Here, you will take that ballot you grabbed from the early voting location, and recreate it using an HTML form and CSS.

## Grading and Assistance

This is a multipart completion grade. I will go through each section and ask, "did you do this section?", if the answer is yes, they you will get the points for that section.

I will be making video tutorials on how to use practical elements from HTML and practical styles from CSS to complete this project. I will make a video tutorial of visiting the early voting place too. It is a short walk from our classroom.

If you want to use your own styles and layout, go for it!

## Conclusion

Once you have completed the project, turn it in on Sakai. Be mindful of time â€“ there might be other assignments and projects out while this one is out. It is due on March 2nd.
