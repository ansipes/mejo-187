## Introduction

This assignment is about exploring Chapel Hill and the voting process. We will then take that information and making an informative, responsive website with it. This assignment is a completion grade. I will be as detailed as usual with feedback.

## I Side With

Some of you may have never voted before or may feel disconnected with the political process. The first step of this assignment is to visit a site that will ask you questions on important issues being discussed this election cycle. After you finish the quiz, you will be presented with a selection of candidates that side with you on the issues.

[Visit ISideWith](https://www.isidewith.com/)

From this quiz, pick out three issues / questions that were asked. Write a sentence about each, in a balanced way. That is, explain the issue / question itself, but do not convey your thinking on it.

## Pick a Candidate

Mind you, this does not have to be a candidate that you prefer or identify with. You can research whichever candidate you like. Put together a short paragraph discussing the issues that matter the most to the candidate. You might include some interesting facts about the candidate as well.

## Check the Polls

How has the candidate performed in the first three primary states? Keep in mind that if you are researching a Republican candidate, some primary races were cancelled because Donald J. Trump is the incumbant.

Lastly, research the average of polls for a candidate in a prospective primary (like a Super Tuesday state) as well as an average of their national performance. You can find these poll of polls on Real Clear Politics.

[Visit Real Clear Politics](https://www.realclearpolitics.com/)

Just to be clear, that's roughly five percentages. One for each of the first three primaries, one average for a prospective primary, and one average for a national poll.

## Visit a Polling Place

Your next task is to visit a polling place. Luckily, there is a one right by campus! It is at Chapel of the Cross. This is the address:

304 E FRANKLIN ST, CHAPEL HILL, NC 27514

{{< figure src="/images/pop-by-the-polls/chapel-of-the-cross-map.png" >}}

It is open from 8:00 AM to 7:30 PM. You can look up other early voting location here:

[One Stop Voting Locations](https://vt.ncsbe.gov/ossite/)

When you are there, you need to do three things:

– Take a selfie outside the entrance
– Grab a sample ballot (Democratic or Republican, does not matter)
– Take notes on what it is like (busy, slow, calm, etc)

## Vote (optional)

Did you know that you can register to vote and vote on the same day in North Carolina, from now until the end of the month? You are required to visit a polling place for this assignment. If you wanted to vote, this would be a good time to do it.

All you need is proof of residency for this county. That could be:

– Utility Bill
– Bank Statement
– Government Check
– Paycheck
– Another government document

Even if you are from out of state, or your parents live somewhere else in North Carolina, you can still vote here if you consider this your "permanent home". You cannot vote in both places.

You are not required to vote for this assignment. You will not receive any reward for doing so. You will not be penalized for not doing so.

If decide to, you _will_ be exercising your constitutional right to vote, and expressing your thoughts on issues like:

– Climate Change
– Healthcare
– Cost of Higher Education
– Money in Politics
– National Security
– Immigration

I think we all have an opinion on at least one of these issues and I think your voice deserves to be heard.

## One Page Website

Make a one page website that has five sections.

### Navigation

Here, you will put the 2020 logo (I'll give it to you), the text "Pop by the Polls", and links to the other four sections of the one page website.

### Issues

Here, you will talk about three issues you read about on ISideWith. Just state them in the plain, non-partisan fashion. One or two sentences for each will be fine.

### Candidate

Here, you will write your paragraph about the candidate you researched. You will also put a photo of that candidate.

You will also summarize the five polls that you researched about the various primaries and national performance.

### Voting

Here, you will write your paragraph about your experience at the early voting location. What was it like? Were there volunteers? Signs? You will also include your selfie here.

### Ballot

Here, you will take that ballot you grabbed from the early voting location, and recreate it using an HTML form and CSS.

## Don't Freak

Not only is this a completion grade, I will be making video tutorials on how to use practical elements from HTML and practical styles from CSS to complete this project. I will make a video tutorial of visiting the early voting place too.

If you want to use your own styles and layout, go for it! But if you would rather follow along with me, that is also cool.

## Conclusion

Once you have completed the project, turn it in on Sakai. Be mindful of time managment. There might be other assignments and projects out while this one is out. It is due on March 2nd.
