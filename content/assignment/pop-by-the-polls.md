draft: false
description: Research the political process, a candidate, visit a polling place, document a sample ballot, and make a website about it.
---

## Overview

Corrections:

- This is for the General Election, not the Primaries. Anywhere you see "primary" or "primaries" mentioned, make sure to replace it with "general election" instead.
- Visiting and taking a photo of a polling place is no longer required because of COVID-19 and remote instruction. Instead, look up your voting precinct, and use a picture of a map or a screenshot from Google Streetview
- A sample ballot can be obtained by visiting your County's Board of Elections website (ask me for help, I'm happy to!)
- You can pick a Presidential candidate from any party (Republican, Democrat, Libertarian, Green, Constitution)
- If I ever mention deploying / GoDaddy in any video, please disregard. We use GitHub pages for our projects.

Corrections:

- I made a small mistake by using absolute positioning instead of fixed positioning. I explain the fix (changing two property values) at the end of the video.
- Please remove the "active" class that I assigned to overlay and the menu (around 19:03). I only added this to illustrate how adding a class can help us visually represent state.
