4. Click "Create repository from template"

5. Go to "Settings" and enable GitHub pages on "master" – "root"

6. Open Visual Studio Code

9. Click "Clone Repository"

10. Click "Clone from GitHub" in the command palette

13. Click "Open" in the little popup in the bottom right to open the repository

14. Click "Go Live" in the bottom corner of Visual Studio Code

15. Follow the directions in the HTML – you are basically reading comments I have made and typing out the appropriate elements
