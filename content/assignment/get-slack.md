## Introduction

We will use Slack to solicit feedback, submit help tickets, and complete group work.

[Join Slack](/join-slack)

## Directions

1. Make your display name whatever people call you in everyday conversation.

2. Upload a profile picture so we can put a face to a name. You are welcome to use an avatar. For example, a Memoji.
