## Introduction

The objective of this exercise is to continue to practice the Web Design Process and apply Web Design Principles.

## Directions

Translate your current mobile design into desktop designs. You should keep both designs in your Adobe XD project. You will need to add the following.

- An additional mobile wireframe art board
- An additional mobile prototype art board
- Three desktop wireframe art boards
- Three desktop prototype art boards

The additional page should be something that should be the next prioritized page for your client. If that is not evident, do you best to imagine what they would like to see or ask me!

## Conclusion

After you complete this assignment, you should feel a little more familiar with the Web Design Process and translating your designs to desktop. Please use the feedback given in class to improve your original submission!
