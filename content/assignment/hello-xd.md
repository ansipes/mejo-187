## Introduction

The objective of this exercise is to warm up, get to know each other and explore Adobe XD.

## Activity

Create a design that tells us about you and expresses your personality. Think of this as a website that showcases your portfolio or one of your interests. Don't worry about mastering all of the features in XD at this point. I just want to see that you've explored the software and done your best to show who you are through design. For inspiration, check out some portfolio sites at awwwards.

## Directions

1. Open Adobe XD
2. Create a new file in XD
3. Title the file firstname_lastname_hello.xd
4. Save your document as you work
5. Create at least two artboards for mobile (iPhone) in the Design window.
6. Add at least one interactive feature using the Prototype window. This could be a link from the homepage to an interior page, a menu, etc.
7. When you finish, publish the link to the prototpye, copy it, and paste it into Sakai

## Conclusion

After you complete this assignment, you should feel a little more familiar with Adobe XD. We will continue to have many more demos of Adobe XD in class, but consider doing a little more learning outside of class.
