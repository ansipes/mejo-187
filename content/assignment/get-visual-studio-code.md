## Install Visual Studio Code

Finish installing Visual Studio Code using the method appropriate for your operating system. On macOS it is recommended to move the application to your **Applications** folder. You may need to approve the application to run on your computer because it is downloaded from the internet.

## Select Extensions

A great feature of Visual Studio Code is that it can be customized with extensions. We will be adding two extensions. Click the **Extensions** icon. These two extensions will drastically improve the developer experience in Visual Studio Code and will save you time.
