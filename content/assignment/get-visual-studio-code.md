## Select Extensions

A great feature of Visual Studio Code is that it can be customized with extensions. We will be adding two extensions. Click the <strong>Extensions</strong> icon. These two extensions will drastically improve the developer experience in Visual Studio Code and will save you time.

### Prettier

Formats our code so that it is always easy to read. Use the search box to locate and install.

### Live Server

Allows us to preview our websites locally, but they will behave like they are already hosted somewhere on the internet. It will also automatically reload your page whenever you make a change. Use the search box to locate and install.

## Configure Editor

To get the most out of the <strong>Prettier</strong> extension, we want our editor to automatically format our file whenever we save it. Click on the <strong>Gear</strong> icon.

Click on <strong>Settings</strong>.

Search for <strong>format on save</strong>. Make sure the box is checked.
