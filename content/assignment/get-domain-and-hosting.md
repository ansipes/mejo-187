## Introduction

In order to publish your websites to the web you will need a domain and hosting.

## Go to GoDaddy

Use the following link to visit GoDaddy. It should apply a special promo that enables \$1/month hosting and a free domain.

[Visit GoDaddy with Promo Code](https://www.offers.com/exit/outbound/offer_id/5195929/ld/offer_tile/c/null/a/null/vb/1655127192784733895/)

## Pick a Plan

Click **Add to Cart** on the **Economy** plan. It is a great fit for us and it is inexpensive!

## Pick a Domain

This promotion includes a free domain, which you will need for this class. Consider picking a domain that is some combination of your name ending with **.com**.

- firstlast.com
- lastfirst.com
- ...

In this example, I entered **mejo187.com** and clicked **Search**.

My domain was available so I clicked **Select and Continue**. If your first pick is not available, scroll down to browse similar domains or enter a new query into the search box.

## Create an Account

In order to manage your domain and hosting, you will need a GoDaddy account. Consider signing in with Amazon or Facebook to simplify the login process. If you decide to make your account manually, **carefully document your username and password**.

## Enter Billing Information

Unfortunately, registering a domain and obtaining hosting with GoDaddy is not free – but we have done well with the applied promo! Enter payment information so that GoDaddy may bill you.

Once you have entered all of your billing information, click **Save**.

## Enter Payment Information

This is where you will enter a credit or debit card. Once you have entered all of your payment information, click **Save**.

## Review Your Order

Almost done! Look over the checkout page and make sure everything looks correct. Your order total should not exceed \$30. If it does,**please do not continue**. Check with your instructor for support – hosting a website shouldn't cost a fortune!

If everything looks correct, go ahead and click **Complete Purchase**.

## Configure Hosting

Now that you have a domain and a hosting plan, you need to combine them to launch a functioning website. If you stay on the same page where you completed your purchase you will be prompted to pick a domain for your hosting plan. Type in the domain you just registered. Then click **Next**.

You will need to pick a data center to host your website. It is best to pick a data center that is close to users, so we will click **North America**.

## Install WordPress

After a minute or so, your server is provisioned at GoDaddy's North America data center. The last thing we have to do is install WordPress, so go ahead and click **Yes, let's do it**.

## Skip Office 365 Setup

This promotion includes a year of Office 365 professional email, but we are just going to skip that bit. If you decide to use it later on, it will still be available for you to use! Go ahead and click **Skip**.

## Go to Dashboard

After a minute or two you will be notified that your web server is ready to go! Click on **Go to Dashboard**.

## Opt Out of Tracking

This is personal preference, but I opt out of GoDaddy's Customer Experience Improvement Program by selecting **No, I don't want to participate in this program** and then clicking **Confirm**.
