## Introduction

Reference some design or component from a website of your choice. Copy the style and functionality into Adobe XD. Reference the demo for help.

[Learning from Others](/demo/learning-from-others/)

## Requirements

Should just be a single component, for example, a caurosel. You only need to use enough art boards to effectively model the interactivity of that component.

The whole idea is that this is an interactive, reusable component. Please do not submit a static art board.

## Submission

Copy and paste the link to the webpage with the original component as well as a link to your Adobe XD project.
