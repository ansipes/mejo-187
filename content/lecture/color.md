## Introduction

Color conveys meaning. Color creates emotion. Color creates identity. Color is so powerful and complex, there’s an entire scientific discipline devoted to studying it.

## Expression

When we use colors on the web, we express them in three numbers: Red, Green, and Blue or RGB. We use these three colors because they can be combined to make most colors on digital displays.

Each color can have from 0 through 255. Typically, you will see these three numbers written in two different ways:

- rgb(0, 0, 0)
- #000000

These two formats represent the same color: black. In the first format, you write each number out entirely and separate them by commas. In the second format, there are no spaces between each color value, and each color value uses just two characters. The color values are compressed using hexadecimals. For our purposes, you should know that hexadecimals are used to represent larger numbers with fewer characters.

Here is what pure white would look like using each format:

- rgb(255, 255, 255)
- #FFFFFF

It is totally acceptable to use either format to represent your colors, but you will likely find the hex format to be more commonplace.

## Color Schemes

Often times, you will need to have more than one color for your project. You can use color schemes to pick colors that will work in a pleasing and harmonious way. You can experiment with all of these color schemes here:

### Monochromatic

These easiest way to create a harmony of colors is to pick one color, then modify its shades, tints, and tones. That is, progressively add black, white, or gray to any given color.

### Analogous

These are colors that are directly adjacent eachother on the color wheel. They are useful in crafting serene and comfortable designs. You will often find analogous color schemes in nature.

### Complementary

These are colors that are directly opposite each other on a color wheel. They can be quite striking. Christmas colors and the Incredible Hulk both feature complementary color schemes.

### Triadic

A triadic color scheme uses three colors that are evenly spaced around the color wheel. To use a triadic harmony successfully, the colors should be carefully balanced - let one color dominate and use the two others for accent.

## Conclusion

After reading through this lecture, you should have a better understanding of the common associations made with colors, the way brands have historically used colors, how we represent colors, and how we can put colors together in an effective color scheme.

You should consider this a very brief introduction to color theory – just enough for this class. If you want to learn more, I recommend the following article.
