## Introduction

Like color, typography is an art and a science. Some would say it’s a lost art, and some would say is an underappreciated science.

## Legibility

Before you can focus on making your text look cool, you have to make sure it’s readable. There are several factors that go into that.

## Pairing

Here are some stratigies for font variation in your work.

### Concordant

One font family with little change in style, size, or weight. Traditional, formal, and calm.

### Contrasting

Combining very different fonts for contrast and drama. You can also contrast color, size, and weight.

### Conflicting

Do not mix fonts that are different but still very similar.

## Categories

We can classify fonts into various categories. Like colors, you will find that different categories of fonts fit specific emotions and industries.

### Serif

Serifs are the little line or stroke added to the ends of letters. Typically communciates history, authority, quality, and class. Also easy to read on print.

### Sans Serif

Sans Serif just means a font without any serifs. Typically used to convey a modern feel. Easier to read on digital displays.

### Display

A wide range of styles typically intended for just the heading of the page. Do not use display fonts for things like buttons, navigation, or body text.

### Hand Writing

Fonts that look hand written. In most cases, the rules for display fonts also apply to hand writing fonts. Great for a casual or authentic feel.

### Monospace

Fonts that assign equal point size to each character. Good for representing code, typewriter effects, or stylized links / buttons. Unless you have a really compelling reason, do not use this as body text.

## Sources

You can get your fonts from different places. You can link to **external fonts** from places like Google Fonts or Adobe Fonts. The more external fonts you use, the slower your page will load.

You can use a subset of fonts that are included in most modern web browsers, typically referred to as **web-safe fonts**. These are highly performant, because the font is already on the machine - it doesn't need to be downloaded.

You can also use **system fonts**, that are linked to the operating system the browser is running in. If you were using macOS, this would be San Francisco. Do not use system fonts unless it is necessary to look like a native application and you have a decent fallback.

## Rules

- Never use more than three fonts. Two is usually fine.
- Mix serif and sans serif.
- Good typography is often that which goes unnoticed.
- Body copy: serif for print, sans serif for the web.
- No more than 50 to 75 characters per line.
- Increase the line-height and letter-spacing to make your text easier to read online.

## Bad Examples

Check out how picking the wrong font can lead to bad outcomes.

## Conclusion

After reading this lecture, you should have a better understanding of what makes a font, how you can modify a font's display, reasons why you should pick a particular font, and more! If you would like to watch an interesting video on typography, watch this video from The Futur.
