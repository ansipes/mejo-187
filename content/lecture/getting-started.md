## Introduction

Here is a little information about what this class will be like as well as some directions to help you prepare. We will follow this guide for our first day of class.

## Hello

Take an opportunity to tell the class a little about yourself. You can mention your year, hobby, occupation, or other general interests.

## Survey

There are a couple bits of information that will help me support you and customize this class to best meet your needs.

[Take the Survey](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSetwUW8_b9NhEy_HcBtpuUvPbVHzIsK50LQifzxQf6xP6rByg/viewform?usp=sf_link)

## Schedule

We will begin each class by taking attendance. Then, one student will be selected at random to give us a quick review of the assigned reading. After that, we will do a demo and go over the corresponding assignment. The rest of class will be dedicated to lab, group activities, and one-on-one feedback.

## Syllabus

Don't worry – we're not going to read the entire syllabus outloud. Head over to Sakai to look at the syllabus and, when you are ready, complete the acknowledgement.

## Software

Instead of a slow trickle of installations throughout the semester, we are going to get everything out of the way at the start. This includes purchasing your domain and hosting (should be no more than thirty dollars). You might already have some of this software – if so, you are ahead of the game! Please complete the following by Monday, January 13th.

- [Get Adobe XD](/assignment/get-adobe-xd/)
- [Get Google Chrome](/assignment/get-google-chrome/)
- [Get Visual Studio Code](/assignment/get-visual-studio-code/)
- [Get Domain and Hosting](/assignment/get-domain-and-hosting/)

## Lecture

After each class, keep your eye on your email or this website. There will be a required reading between each class. There will be a reading quiz on Sakai for you to complete before the next class. They will be short and easy – and you can review them at your own pace.

This helps us get the most value of being in class together; more time to collaborate, troubleshoot, and ask questions.
