## Introduction

Here are some simple rules you can follow to improve your web designs.

## Contrast

Use colors, fonts, shapes, size, space and imagery to create contrast between elements. By creating contrast in our designs, we can guide the users eye and focus them on the most important part of the document. It can also help distinguish user interface elements, making it easier for our users to know what to click.

### Color

{{< figure src="/images/new-girl.jpg" title="Jessica Day wears a contrasting color to distiguish herself from other cast members." >}}

### Font

{{< figure src="/images/font-contrast.png" title="Pairing two contrasting fonts can have a pleasant visual effect." >}}

### Shape

{{< figure src="/images/shape-contrast.jpg" title="A distinct shape can stand out from the crowd." >}}

### Size

{{< figure src="/images/size-contrast.png" title="The two orange circles are the same size, but are percieved differntly." >}}

### Space

{{< figure src="/images/space-contrast.jpg" title="There is only a single area of focus on Google. The space around it is empty." >}}

### Imagery

{{< figure src="/images/image-contrast.png" title="Notice the difference in color and mood between the subject and the foreground." >}}

## Repetition

By repeating visual elements throughout your work, you can establish a familiarity with the user. You should repeat things like color, logo, font, layouts, navigation elements and more.

## Alignment

Do not underestimate how important alignment can be to your designs. Without it, things can just feel off. Humans have evolved to find balance and symmetry visually appealing.

## Proximity

We are naturally inclined to assume some relationship between elements that are in close proximity to each other. Use this to your and your users' advantage, by placing related items close to eachother and providing some space between unrelated items.

{{< figure src="/images/proximity.jpg" title="The items are identical but notice how they are grouped." >}}

## Purpose

Think critically about every element or feature your introduce into your design. Does it help the user or add value to the site? If not, consider leaving it out of your design â€“ even if it is super cool.

## Conclusion

These are the web design principles we will be following throughout the semester: Contrast, Repetion, Alignment, Proximity, and Purpose. If you take these principles into consideration when crafting your design, you will end up with something that is pleasing to look at and easy to use.
