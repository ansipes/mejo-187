description: How to import resources from websites like Awwwards to model layouts, styles, and more.

## Introduction

You probably have heard me recommend referencing sites like Awwwards, BÄ“hance, and Dribble for inspiration, but you might be wondering how to go about that. Should you pull up the website on one screen and Adobe XD in the other? Should you manually take screenshots of different sections of a page?

I've got a solution for you that can help.

## Open in Chrome

Open up the website you'd like to reference in Chrome.

{{< figure src="/images/learning-from-others/open-in-chrome.png" >}}

## Open up DevTools

DevTools is a feature of Google Chrome that lets us inspect a website's HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and so much more. In this case, we are going to use it to preview a website at a certain resolution and take a full page screen shot.

Click the kebab menu and then open up DevTools.

## Set Resolution

Click the **Toggle Device Toolbar** button and then select **Responsive** as the device type. Type in 1280 for the width and 720 for the height.

## Screenshot

Click the kebab menu in the top right corner of the **Device Toolbar** and click **Capture full size screenshot**. This will take a screenshot of the entire page for you.

## Import

Now that you have this handy photo, you can import and use it as a background of sorts, in Adobe XD.

## Reference

Boom! Now you can trace shapes and layouts, sample colors, and quickly reference the design you found inspiring.

## Conclusion

I hope that at the end of this written demo, you feel a little more comfortable browsing the work of others, and learning from their design decisions.
