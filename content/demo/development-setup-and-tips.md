## Setup

{{< vimeo 391613621 >}}

Watch this video to properly configure Visual Studio Code and Google Chrome for a comfortable and productive developer experience.

## Tips

Here are a list of tips to make using Visual Studio Code easier to use.

### Abbreviations

Visual Studio Code comes with a plugin called Emmet, that allows you to type abbreviations for common HTML snippets. It is extremely powerful, but at a basic level, you should at least use it to type in your HTML boilerplate. To do that, simply type in `html:5` in an empty HTML file and press enter.

If you are someone who really values saving time and being efficient, check out this video that talks about Emmet in more detail.

### Save Often

Always press ⌘S (Command + S) after you are finished typing in Visual Studio Code. This way, your work is always saved and your preview in the browser is always up to date. If you are wondering why you aren't seeing your changes in the browser, it is almost definitely because you have not yet saved.

### Switch Apps

If you are working on a smaller screen and enjoy having Visual Studio Code and Google Chrome as fullscreen windows, use ⌘⇥ (Command + Tab) to quickly switch back and forth between windows. You can also use a three finger swipe on the trackpad.

### Path Autocomplete

Any time you are typing a relative URL, use Visual Studio Code's built-in path suggestions. Inside of any `src` or `href` attribute, always type `./` first. If the file you are looking to reference is at the same folder level or deeper, just use the suggestions. If the file you are looking to reference is up a level, type in `../` until you reach the desired folder level, then use the suggestions. This will save you a lot of headache.

### Search File

Press ⌘F (Command + F) to search for something within a file. You can also find and replace.

### Search Project

Press ⌘⇧F (Command + Shift + F) to search for something within your entire project. Also available by clicking the magnifying glass in the left toolbar. You can also find and replace.
