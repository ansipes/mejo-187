## Introduction

Welcome to the resources page, where you can find tons of tutorials, assets, and inspiration that can help improve your assignments and projects in this course.

## Tutorials

It can be handy to reference a third party resource as a supplement or an extension of the material covered in class. Check out these awesome tutorials to learn more about Adobe XD, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

### Adobe XD

Unfortunately, we do not have time to completely master Adobe XD in class – but you can continue your learning by viewing these LinkedIn Learning modules. They are free for UNC students.

## Assets

From fonts to colors to photos – we've got you covered. Check out these free assets you can use to level up your assignments.

### Fonts

There are tons of free fonts out there to pick from. You can use these fonts in your Adobe XD prototypes and on your websites!

### Images

Check out these free photo sites that grant you irrevocable, nonexclusive, worldwide copyright license to download, copy, modify, distribute, perform, and use their photos for free. Attribution is encouraged but not required. When we move on to coding, I'll show you how to link back to a photographers profile to credit them.
