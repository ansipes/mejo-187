## Introduction

Welcome to the resources page, where you can find tons of tutorials, assets, and inspiration that can help improve your assignments and projects in this course.

## Documentation

This should be your number one resource for any questions regarding HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I personally prefer Mozilla, but both of these websites will answer most of your questions.

- [MDN web docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/)
- [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/)

## Tutorials

It can be handy to reference a third party resource as a supplement or an extension of the material covered in class. Check out these awesome tutorials to learn more about Adobe XD, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

### Adobe XD

Unfortunately, we do not have time to completely master Adobe XD in class – but you can continue your learning by viewing these LinkedIn Learning modules. They are free for UNC students.

- [Sign Up for LinkedIn Learning](https://software.sites.unc.edu/linkedin/)
- [Adobe XD Essential Training: Design](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/adobe-xd-essential-training-design-2/take-your-design-to-the-next-level)
- [Adobe XD Essential Training: Prototyping](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/adobe-xd-essential-training-prototype-and-share-2/prototype-your-designs-efficiently)

### Coding

Are you looking for a crash course on how to take an existing Adobe XD design and make it into a real website? Watch this tutorial!

## Assets

From fonts to colors to photos – we've got you covered. Check out these free assets you can use to level up your assignments.

### Fonts

There are tons of free fonts out there to pick from. You can use these fonts in your Adobe XD prototypes and on your websites!

- [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/)
- [Adobe Fonts](https://fonts.adobe.com/)

### Colors

So, while colors themselves may not be assets, color pairings are! Check out these cool libraries of premade swatches and gradients.

- [Color Hunt](https://colorhunt.co/)
- [Gradient Hunt](https://gradienthunt.com/)

### Images

Check out these free photo sites that grant you irrevocable, nonexclusive, worldwide copyright license to download, copy, modify, distribute, perform, and use their photos for free. Attribution is encouraged but not required. When we move on to coding, I'll show you how to link back to a photographers profile to credit them.

## YouTube

Here are some YouTube Channels the I find helpful and entertaining.

### Short Explainers

These are super short videos that explain basic concepts:

[Watch CSS Flexbox in 100s](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLhX116lGsd55CBxbPNNEvzeWsYGGhPclU)
[Watch CSS Grid in 100s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuOXPWCh-6o)

### Kevin Powell

I watch this channel all the time. Great explainers / best-practices for CSS.

### Gary Simon

Gary teaches full stack development! Which means you will see tutorials regarding UI/UX, Frontend Dev, Backend Dev, Graphic Design and more!

I think he is great at the technical aspects of web design, and I think you will find his coding tutorials efficient and informative.
